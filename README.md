## How to load on your machine

This was meant to be a simplistic build so there is a simplistic install. Follow the steps bellow: 

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Open up the index.html file.
  1. It was designed to work and look the same while running through your file system or local host.
3. Enter a program into the type box.
4. Press the compile button!

## Future

The main complier functionality will likely only see small improvements when I have free time. However, I do have plans to improve the basic look of the page as well as add functionality to the top navigation bar. This is entirely dependent on when my free-time permits this. Like I said above though these changes will not go into this repository. Instead they can be found in the staging-repository that is also public.
